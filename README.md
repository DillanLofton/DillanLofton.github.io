Computer Information Systems Major | Building Projects in Java, SQL, and Network Securi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! I’m Dillan Lofton, a Computer Information Systems (CIS) major at Northwestern State University of Louisiana, concentrating in Networking and Cybersecurity. Alongside my studies, I work full-time as a Lead Maintenance Technician at Amcor, where I’ve developed a strong foundation in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and system reliability — skills that translate perfectly into IT infrastructure and network management.

I’m passionate about technology that connects and protects — from designing networks and securing systems, to writing Java and SQL programs that automate and analyze data. My GitHub serves as a growing portfolio of projects that reflect both my coursework and personal experimentation, including:

💻 Java applications focusing on logic, control structures, and user interaction

🧠 SQL and database design projects, from ER diagrams to normalization and advanced queries

☁️ AWS cloud labs, where I’ve built VPCs, launched EC2 web servers, and configured secure environments

My long-term goal is to become a Network Administrator or Cybersecurity Analyst, combining my passion for infrastructure, security, and automation to build efficient, resilient IT environments. I’m also exploring data analysis and visualization as a complementary skill — understanding how to interpret the information that networks and systems generate.

I’m currently pursuing industry certifications, including:

✅ CompTIA ITF+ (earned)

✅ CompTIA A+ (earned)

🎯 CompTIA Network+ (in progress)

☁️ AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (studying)

When I’m not studying or building in my lab, I enjoy spending time with my family, planning creative projects, and continuously learning how technology shapes the way we live and communicate.
